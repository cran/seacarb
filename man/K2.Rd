\usage{
K2(S = 35, T = 25, P = 0, k1k2 = "x", pHscale = "T")
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{S}{Salinity, default is 35}
  \item{T}{Temperature in degrees Celsius, default is 25oC}
  \item{P}{Hydrostatic pressure in bar (surface = 0), default is 0}
  \item{k1k2}{"l" for using K1 and K2 from Lueker et al. (2000), "m06" from Millero et al. (2006), "m10" from Millero (2010) and "r" from Roy et al. (1993). "x" is the default flag; the default value is then "l", except if T is outside the range 2 to 35oC and/or S is outside the range 19 to 43. In these cases, the default value is "m10". }
  \item{pHscale}{choice of pH scale: "T" for using the total scale, "F" for using the free scale and "SWS" for using the seawater scale, default is total scale}
}

\details{The Lueker et al. (2000) constant is recommended by Guide to Best Practices for Ocean CO2 Measurements (2007). It is, however, critical to consider that each formulation is only valid for specific ranges of temperature and salinity:

\itemize{
\item Roy et al. (1993): S ranging between 0 and 45 and T ranging between 0 and 45oC.

\item Lueker et al. (2000): S ranging between 19 and 43 and T ranging between 2 and 35oC.

\item Millero et al. (2006): S ranging between 0.1 and 50 and T ranging between 1 and 50oC.

\item Millero (2010): S ranging between 1 and 50 and T ranging between 0 and 50oC. Millero (2010) provides a K1 and K2 formulation for the seawater, total and free pH scales. Therefore, when this method is used and if P=0, K1 and K2 are computed with the formulation corresponding to the pH scale given in the flag "pHscale". 
}

The arguments can be given as a unique number or as vectors. If the lengths of the vectors are different, the longer vector is retained and only the first value of the other vectors is used. It can therefore be critical to use vectors of the same length. 

The pressure correction was applied on the seawater scale. Hence, if needed, values were first transformed from the total scale to the seawater scale, the pressure correction applied as described by Millero (1995), and the value was transformed back to the required scale (T, F or SWS).}
