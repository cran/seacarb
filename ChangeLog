--------------------------
version 2.0.6, 2009-02-09
Changes made thanks to comments kindly provided by Andreas Hofmann (A.Hofmann@nioo.knaw.nl):
- Kf was modified in order to convert Kf from free scale to total scale after pressure corrections in the Dickson and Goyet Method.

--------------------------
version 2.0.5, 2008-12-08

Changes made thanks to comments kindly provided by Andreas Hofmann (A.Hofmann@nioo.knaw.nl):
- K2 modified to fix a bug which provided warnings when several pressures were used.
- Khs modified to fix a bug (in coefficient a2).
- The value of the R constant was updated according to Dickson et al. (2007). The new value is 8.314475 J/(K*mol).
- kconv was modified in order to include pressure correction.

--------------------------
version 2.0.4, 2008-11-06

- pH, pTA, pmix, pCa, and pgas now accept Sit (concentration of silicate) and Pt (concentration of total phosphate) as input arguments.
- Various style changes in the help files.

--------------------------
version 2.0.3, 2008-11-04

- The code of all functions which calculate constants was modified in order to be able to use vectors as input arguments.
- The man files were changed accordingly by adding a "details" section.

--------------------------
version 2.0.1, 2008-10-28

- added the data set seacarb_test
- added and example to use carb with a data frame
- various cosmetic changes in the help files

--------------------------
version 2.0, 2008-10-27

- added function "pCa" which calculates the changes in the saturation states of aragonite and calcite resulting from the manipulation of the calcium concentration
- added function "pgas" which calculates the carbonate chemistry after changes in pCO2 generated by gas bubbling
- added function "pmix" which calculates the carbonate chemistry after mixing of two water samples with different pCO2
- added function "ppH" which calculates the carbonate chemistry after pH manipulations through addition of acid or base
- added function "pTA" which calculates the carbonate chemistry following addition of CO3 or HCO3
- carb function modified to return only S, T, P, pH, pCO2, fCO2, HCO3, CO3, DIC, ALK, OmegaAragonite and OmegaCalcite.
- added function "buffer" which calculates the buffer parameters of the seawater carbonate system. 
- carb function modified in order to closely follow the recommendations of the "Guide to Best Practices for Ocean CO2 Measurements" (Dickson et al., 2007). Phosphate ans ilicate concentrations are now taken into account.
- K1 function uses the equation of Lueker et al. (2000) by default
- K2 function uses the equation the method of Lueker et al. (2000) by default
- Kf function uses, by default, the equation of Perez and Fraga (1987). The equation of Dickson and Roy can be used with the argument kf = 'dg'.

--------------------------
version 1.2.3, 2007-11-27

- carb function modified to allow NA values in the input data. A warning is returned if this happens but all other data rows are processed. Change made by Bernard Gentili.

--------------------------
version 1.2.2, 2007-09-09

- correction of the definition of PiH and PhiH in the "carb" documentation file

- cosmetic changes to some documentation files

--------------------------

- cosmetic changes to some documentation files

--------------------------
version 1.2, 2007-08-21

- added function "speciation" which estimates the concentration of the various ionic forms of a molecule as a function of pH (contributed by Karline Soetaert)
- added function "kconv" which provides conversion factors to change the pH scale of dissociation constants (contributed by Karline Soetaert)
- added function "pHconv" which provides conversion factors for changing the pH scale (contributed by Karline Soetaert)
- added function "Kn" which provides the ammonium dissociation constant (contributed by Karline Soetaert)
- added function "Khs" which provides the dissociation constant of hydrogen sulfide (contributed by Karline Soetaert)
