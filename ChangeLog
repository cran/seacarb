version 2.2.3, 2010-01-06

- minor changes on function ocean acidification and its help file

-----------------------------------
version 2.2.2, 2009-12-31

- oa: new function added. It describes the different ways to simulate an ocean acidification.
- Minor corrections in pph to take into account the dilution effect on DIC and ALK. However, the effect of dilution on salinity is not taken into account (i.e; it is assumed that the salinity change is minor or that the acid added has the same salinity as the sample).

-----------------------------------
version 2.2.1, 2009-10-17

- Help of pmix revised with the correct definition of wf: "Weight fraction of the high CO2 seawater per kg seawater" (instead of "Weight fraction of the high CO2 seawater vs normal seawater")
- Other minor changes to some help files.


-----------------------------------
version 2.2, 2009-10-06

- Andreas Hofmann identified bugs in the pressure corrections. These were fixed as explained below.
- K1, K2, pK1, pK2, pK3, Kw, Kb, Khs, Ksi: pH is converted from the total to the SWS scale before doing the pressure corrections.
- Kf using the Perez and Fraga formulation (kf = "pf"): pH is converted from the total to the free scale before doing the pressure correction
- kconv: it is now possible to choose the formulation of Kf ("pf" for using Kf from Perez and Fraga (1987) and "dg" for using Kf from Dickson and Riley (1979), default is "pf").
- K1, K2, pK1, pK2, pK3, Kw, Kb, Khs, Ksi: help files updated with information on the pressure correction.
- Kh, Kspa and Kspc: minor changes were made in the example section of the help files.
